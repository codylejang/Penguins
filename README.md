# Penguin species prediction
Our group members, Cody Lejang, Megan Tieu, and Arely Perez, collaborated on data acquisition and preparation. Arely developed the first table featuring Culmen Length and Depth. Cody created a scatter plot, Arely a histogram, and Megan a box plot, with each member providing explanations for their figures. Megan guided the figure selection process. We jointly developed the models and initial code. Arely focused on the Logistic Regression model, Cody on the Random Forest model, and Megan on the Support Vector model. Cody spearheaded the discussion section, and we all reviewed and revised each other's work and code.
